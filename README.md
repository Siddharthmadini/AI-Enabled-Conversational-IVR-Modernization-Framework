# AI Enabled Conversational IVR Modernization Framework  
## Module 1 – Legacy System Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation for Module 1 of the Conversational IVR Modernization Framework internship project.

Module 1 focuses on analyzing an existing VXML-based IVR system and defining the technical and functional integration requirements required to align it with:

- Azure Communication Services (ACS)
- BAP Platform

## Scope

- Review legacy VXML-based IVR architecture
- Assess system capabilities
- Identify integration requirements for ACS and BAP
- Analyze technical challenges, constraints, and compatibility gaps

This module covers analysis and requirements gathering only.

## Legacy System Assumption

The analysis is based on a representative enterprise IVR architecture (Cisco CVP-style VXML execution model) including:

- PSTN call routing
- SIP gateway
- VXML execution engine
- Grammar-based ASR
- Backend REST/SOAP APIs

## Key Gaps Identified

- Grammar-based input vs AI-driven intent detection
- Stateless IVR vs conversational context handling
- Limited streaming capability
- Potential latency from AI processing
- Data format compatibility issues

- Module_1_Legacy_System_Analysis_Only.docx — Detailed analysis and integration documentation.

## Status

Module 1 completed – Legacy System Analysis and Requirements Gathering.
